# winaudit-python

Executes automatically a diagnostic of the computer every monday and outputs it to a pdf file named with the actual date.

To install all the pip librarys required
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt

```

after that you need to fix the settings in the winaudit program like:
- the time you need to wait until the diag is done
- the format that is been saved ( I rater choose pdf)
- make sure that the program will be open in full screen ( or adjust the position of the pixels )
